# St. Martha Website
This is the design for the upcoming 2015 redesign of the St. Martha Catholic Church website located in Louisville, KY.  The barebones PHP and CSS files are included along with a javascript slider.<br><br>
All you need to get it up and running is to put the files in the htdocs folder of an apache server.

## Requirements
- Apache Webserver (would recommend installing <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org">XAMPP</a>)<br>
- PHP
